    "# Q1: Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file\n",
    "# opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "r: Read mode. It opens the file for reading, and if the file doesn't exist, it raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "w: Write mode. It opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "a: Append mode. It opens the file for writing, but if the file already exists, it appends the new data to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "b: Binary mode. It opens the file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files like images or executable files.\n",
    "\n",
    "x: Exclusive creation. It creates a new file, and if the file already exists, the open() function will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "t: Text mode. It is the default mode when working with text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: Why is the close() function used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function is used to close an open file. It is important to close a file because it releases the resources associated with the file, such as the file descriptor. Failure to close a file properly may lead to resource leaks and can cause issues with file access in subsequent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: Python program to create, write, and read a text file:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('data_scientist.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('I want to become a Data Scientist')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('data_scientist.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "# Q4: Explanation of read(), readline(), and readlines():\n",
    "\n",
    "read(): Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "readline(): Reads a single line from the file.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "readlines(): Reads all the lines of the file into a list.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "    print(lines)\n",
    "# Q5: Why with statement is used with open()? What is the advantage?\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement is used with open() to ensure that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes. The advantage is that it simplifies the management of resources (like file handling) and ensures that cleanup is done properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    # File is automatically closed after exiting the block\n",
    "Q6: Explanation of write() and writelines() functions with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "write(): Writes a string to the file.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "writelines(): Writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "lines = ['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n', 'Line 3\\n']\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "In both cases, the specified content is written to the file."
